- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, welcome to the @LAELlabs GitHub page!
This is a work in progress page containing information about lab equipment, examples of use of equipment,
coding for experiments, commonly used software and associated issues for LAEL research and much more.

You can help develop this page by emailing lab technician Andrea Siem (a.siem@lancaster.ac.uk)
about your common software issues so they can be shared here for information. You can also help by sharing 
your scripts, coding and experiment designs should you wish to make them publically available for others in the department. 

The dream is to incrementally create a repository for lab-based research needs that neatly holds most of our departmental needs in one place.
Let the dream come true!

LAELlabs/LAELlabs is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
